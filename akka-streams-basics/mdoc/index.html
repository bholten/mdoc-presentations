# Futures

---

### Futures

- Why `Futures`?
  1. Everything Akka Streams returns ("materializes") will be wrapped in a `Future`.
  2. Methods returning `Future` will drive your entire application

---

### What is a `Future`?

- Represents a value which may or may not *currently* be available, but will either:
  1. return a value at some point, or
  2. return an exception if that value could not be made available

```scala
def makeCoffee(): Future[Coffee] = ???

def doOrder(): Unit = {
  makeCoffee().onComplete {
    case Success(coffee) => println(s"Finished making $coffee!")
    case Failure(reason) => println(s"Oh no! An error: $reason!")
  }
}
```
---

### What is a `Future`?

- Require an `ExecutionContext` responsible for executing computations
- `ExecutionContext`s can run different `Executor`s (work-stealing, fixed thread-pool, cached thread-pool, etc.)
- Defining a `Future` in the presence of an `ExecutionContext` will run the `Future` --
different from other systems like Cats Effect `IO`, which is more purely a _description_ of a computation.

```scala
// Note: these are VERY different!
val future1: Future[Int] = Future { Thread.sleep(1000); 42 }
def future2: Future[Int] = Future { Thread.sleep(1000); 42 }
```

---

### `Future` API

```scala
// not real code, but similar
trait Future[+A] {
  def onComplete(k: Try[A] => Unit): Unit
  // transform successful results
  def map[B](f: A => B): Future[B]
  def flatMap[B](f: A => Future[B]): Future[B]
  def zip[B](fb: Future[B]): Future[(A, B)]
  // transform failures
  def recover(f: Exception => A): Future[A]
  def recoverWith(f: Exception => Future[A]): Future[A]
}
```
---

### `Futures` in Sequence

```scala
trait AccountApi {
  def login(credentials: String): Future[Token]
  def get(userToken: Token, accountId: String): Future[Account]
  def update(userToken: Token, accountId: String, account: Account): Future[Unit]
  def logout(userToken: Token): Future[Unit]
}
```


```scala
val credentials: String = ???
val accountId: String = ???
val newAccount: Account = ???
val accountApi: AccountApi = ???
implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ???

def program(): Future[Unit] =
  accountApi.login(credentials).flatMap { userToken =>
    accountApi.getAccount(userToken, accountId).flatMap { account =>
      accountApi.updateAccount(userToken, account.id, newAccount).flatMap { _ =>
        accountApi.logout(userToken)
      }
    }
  }
```

---
### `Futures` in Sequence

- Because `Future` has `map` and `flatMap`, you can rewrite using `for` syntax

```scala
def program(): Future[Unit] =
  for {
    userToken <- accountApi.login(credentials)
    account   <- accountApi.getAccount(userToken, accountId)
    _         <- accountApi.updateAccount(userToken, account.id, newAccount)
    _         <- accountApi.logout(userToken)
  } yield ()
```
---

### Running `Future`s in Parallel

```scala
trait WeatherStation {
  def getTemperature(city: String): Future[Double]
}

```

```scala
val weatherStation: WeatherStation = ???

def chicago(): Future[Double] = weatherStation.getTemperature("chicago")
def seattle(): Future[Double] = weatherStation.getTemperature("seattle")

def result(): Future[(Double, Double)] = chicago() zip seattle()
```

# Future Best Practices

---

### Future Best Practices

-  Do not wrap purely CPU-bound operations in `Future`

```scala
// Bad:
def add(x: Int, y: Int) = Future { x + y }
// Good:
def add(x: Int, y: Int) = x + y
```

---

### Future Best Practices

- Avoid blocking -- `Future` all the way down

```scala
// Bad:
def fetchSomething: Future[String] = ???

// later ...
val result = Await.result(fetchSomething, 3.seconds)
result.toUpperCase
```

```scala
// Good:
def fetchSomething: Future[String] = ???

fetchSomething.map(_.toUpperCase)
```

---

### Future Best Practices

- Use Scala's BlockContext on blocking I/O

```scala
// Bad:
Future {
  someBlockingCall()
}
```
```scala
// Good:
import scala.concurrent.blocking

Future {
  blocking {
      someBlockingCall()
    }
  }
}
```

???

By blocking we mean: blocks the underlying thread

---

### Future Best Practices

- Use a separate thread-pool for blocking I/O

Calls marked `blocking` signal to the `BlockingContext`, which allows the `ExecutionContext` to decide how to
schedule the operation such that non-blocking calls won't be starved of threads.

```scala
import java.util.concurrent.Executors

// Good
private val ioThreadPool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool()
// Better
private val ioThreadPool = /** loaded from configuration **/
```
---
### Future Best Practices

- Do not hardcode the thread-pool / execution context

Introduces coupling between the `ExecutionContext` and your logic.

```scala
// Bad:
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

def doSomething: Future[Unit] = ???
```

```scala
// Good:
def doSomething(implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[Unit] = ???
```

# Akka Streams Fundamentals

---

### Stream Processing

- Processing a number of elements (possibly infinite)
- Pushing/pulling data through a "pipeline"
- Pipeline is a chain of operations on each element
- Operations are similar to Scala collections (map, flatMap, filter, etc.)

---

### Motivation for Streaming APIs

- Data sources can be intermittent or unbounded
- Processing data that cannot fit into memory
- Easy control of processing rates, failure, etc.

---

### Back-pressure / Flow Control

- _Back-pressure_ is a mechanism to control the _rate_ at which an
upstream publishers is emitting data to a downstream subscriber in proportion
to the subscriber's processing ability


---

### Reactive Streams

- "Reactive Streams is an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure."
- A set of interaction rules (the Specification)
- A Service Provider Interface (SPI), not an API
- A technology compliance kit (TCK)

Core concepts:
- publisher = emits elements asynchronously
- subscriber = consumes elements
- processor = transforms elements
- backpressure = subscriber drives flow

---

### Reactive Streams Ecosystem

- Part of Java since Java 9 (java.util.concurrent.Flow)
- Ported to .NET and other languages
- Similar libraries Project Reactor, Vert.X, etc.

---

### Stream Fundamentals

- Akka Streams provides a _high-level API_ for stream processing
- Implements the _Reactive Streams protocol_ on all of its layers
- Familiar Scala collections API (map, filter, etc.)

---

### Simple Example

```scala
import akka.actor._
import akka.stream.scaladsl.{Flow, Sink, Source}
import scala.concurrent.Future

implicit val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem()

def eventuallyResult: Future[Int] =
  Source(1 to 10)
    .map(_ * 2)
    .runFold(0)((acc, next) => acc + next)
```

---

### Simple Example

```scala
import akka.actor._
import akka.stream.scaladsl.{Flow, Sink, Source}
import scala.concurrent.Future

implicit val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem()

def eventuallyResult: Future[Int] =
  Source(1 to 10)
    .map(_ * 2)
    .runWith(
      Sink.fold(0)((acc, next) => acc + next)
    )
```

---
### Simple Example

```scala
import akka.actor._
import akka.stream.scaladsl.{Flow, Sink, Source}
import scala.concurrent.Future

implicit val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem()

val numbers = Source(1 to 10)
val double  = Flow[Int].map(_ * 2)
val sum     = Sink.fold(0)((acc: Int, next: Int) => acc + next)

def eventuallyResult: Future[Int] =
  numbers.via(double).runWith(sum)
```

---

### Shapes of Processing Stages

- The "steps" of a processing pipeline (the Graph) are called _stages_
- The term _operator_ is used for the fluent DSL's API, such as map, flatMap, filter, etc.

Three main shapes of Akka Streams

1. Source - has exactly 1 output
2. Flow   - has exactly 1 input and 1 output
3. Sink   - has exactly 1 input

---

### Comparison to Reactive Streams

- `Source[O, _]`  is equivalent to `Publisher[O]`
- `Sink[I, _]`    is equivalent to `Subscriber[I]`
- `Flow[I, O, _]` is equivalent to `Processor[I, O]`

### Running (Materializing) a Stream

- Running a stream "materializes" it to a value
- This is the return value after the stream completes
- The `Materializer` looks at the Graph description and executes it (using Actors)

```scala
def eventuallyResult: Future[Int] =
  Source(1 to 10)
    .map(_ * 2)
    .runFold(0)((acc, next) => acc + next)
```

In this example, the _materialized value_ is the `Future[Int]` returned after summing all the numbers together.

```scala
val sum: Sink[Int, Future[Int]] =
  Sink.fold(0)((acc: Int, next: Int) => acc + next)
```
---

### Materializing Different Values

- Each stage in your Graph can materialize a value, as seen in the type signature

```scala
Source[+Out, +Mat]
Flow[-In, +Out, +Mat]
Sink[-In, +Mat]
```

- How do you choose which materialized value to keep in your Graph?

```scala
import akka.actor._
import akka.stream.scaladsl.{Flow, Keep, Sink, Source}
import scala.concurrent.Future

implicit val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem()

val numbers = Source(1 to 10)
val double  = Flow[Int].map(_ * 2)
val sum     = Sink.fold(0)((acc: Int, next: Int) => acc + next)

def eventuallyResult: Future[Int] =
  numbers.via(double).toMat(sum)(Keep.right).run()
```

---

### Operator Fusion

- The `Materializer` will _fuse_ operators together when it builds the Graph
- E.g. successive calls to `.map` will be combined and processed by a single Actor internally
- To introduce parallelism, use `.async` operator to create an "async boundary", or `*Async` versions of operators

### Structuring your application

- Akka Streams can be thought of as a DSL for creating `Future`s
- Hide effects behind `Future`s or `Actor`s
- `Future` becomes your fundamental effect type
